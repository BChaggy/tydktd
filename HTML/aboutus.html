      <b>History</b>
    </div>

    <div id=historyentry>
      <p3>Durham House of Pets has been in business for 70 years. DHP was founded by Nancy and Paul Newart in 1948. They had a great love for pets and deicided to open their own store, so they could support not only their pets but pets from all across New Hampshire. The store started out as a very small shop, selling basic pet needs. Over the years the amount of customers grew. Nancy and Paul expanded their shop into two neighboring store fronts. They took down the walls and started expanding. We now are seen with 2,600 sq ft to our name and much more to offer for your pets. Paul and Nancy are still going strong and are living above the store.</p3>
